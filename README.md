# Sentencer

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/kylestetz/Sentencer.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/kylestetz/Sentencer)

`sentencer` is a node.js module for madlibs-style sentence templating. It is a simple templating engine that accepts strings with actions embedded in them:

```javascript
"This is {{ an_adjective }} sentence."
```

Where each action returns a random string selected from a list:

```javascript
"This is a bankrupt sentence."
```

Think of it as madlibs for Javascript. Want to roll your own lorem ipsum generator? `Sentencer` allows you to write the structure of your sentences and plug in any kind of vocabulary you choose.

`Sentencer` was written for and powers [Metaphorpsum](http://metaphorpsum.com). The noun and adjective lists come from a relatively small curated selection of Ashley Bovan's excellent [Word Lists for Writers](http://www.ashley-bovan.co.uk/words/partsofspeech.html).

### How

`npm install sentencer --save`

```javascript
var Sentencer = require('sentencer');

Sentencer.make("This sentence has {{ a_noun }} and {{ an_adjective }} {{ noun }} in it.");
// returns something like "This sentence has a bat and a finless cinema in it."
```

Here are all of the options, described in detail below.

```javascript
var Sentencer = require('sentencer');

Sentencer.configure({
  // the list of nouns to use. Sentencer provides its own if you don't have one!
  nounList: [],

  // the list of adjectives to use. Again, Sentencer comes with one!
  adjectiveList: [],

  // additional lists that generate actions for the template engine to use.
  customLists: [
    {
      // add action for animal
      key: "animal",
      values: ["dog", "cat", "elephant"],
      // if named, add action for articlize
      articlize: "an_animal",
      // if named, add action for pluralize
      pluralize: "animals"
    },
    {
        key: "band",
        values: ["The Beatles", "The Who", "Styx"],
        // no key or empty value, don't articlize
        articlize: "",
        // no key or empty value, don't pluralize
        pluralize: ""
    }
  ],

  // additional actions for the template engine to use.
  // you can also redefine the preset actions here if you need to.
  // See the "Add your own actions" section below.
  actions: {
    my_action: function(){
      return "something";
    }
  }
});
```

### Actions

`Sentencer` works by recognizing "actions" within `{{ double_brackets }}`. It replaces these actions with strings. The default actions are `{{ noun }}`, `{{ a_noun }}`, `{{ nouns }}`, `{{ adjective }}`, and `{{ an_adjective }}`, but you can extend `Sentencer` to include any kind of actions you need!

The default actions will continue to work if you pass in new a `nounList` and/or `adjectiveList` using `Sentencer.configure`.

`Sentencer`'s actions are written semantically so that your sentence template still reads as a sentence. While this was simply a design decision, it does make templates easier to read and you are encouraged to follow this format if you create custom actions.

#### `"{{ noun }}"`

Returns a random noun from the noun list.

```javascript
var noun = Sentencer.make("{{ noun }}")
// "actor", "knight", "orchid", "pizza", etc.
```

#### `"{{ a_noun }}"`

Returns a random noun from the noun list with "a" or "an" in front of it.

```javascript
var nounWithArticle = Sentencer.make("{{ a_noun }}")
// "an actor", "a knight", "an orchid", "a pizza", etc.
```

#### `"{{ nouns }}"`

Returns the pluralized form of a random noun from the noun list. It's not 100% perfect, but it's probably 97% perfect.

```javascript
var pluralNoun = Sentencer.make("{{ nouns }}")
// "actors", "knights", "orchids", "pizzas", etc.
```

#### `"{{ adjective }}"`

Returns a random adjective from the adjective list.

```javascript
var adjective = Sentencer.make("{{ adjective }}")
// "blending", "earthy", "rugged", "untamed", etc.
```

#### `"{{ an_adjective }}"`

Returns a random adjective from the adjective list with "a" or "an" in front of it.

```javascript
var adjective = Sentencer.make("{{ an_adjective }}")
// "a blending", "an earthy", "a rugged", "an untamed", etc.
```

### Add your own actions

When configuring `Sentencer` you can provide your own "actions", which are just functions that return something. The name of the function that you pass into `actions` is how you will reference it within a sentence template.

Here's an example of an action that returns a random number from 1 to 10.

```javascript
var Sentencer = require('sentencer');

Sentencer.configure({
  actions: {
    number: function() {
      return Math.floor( Math.random() * 10 ) + 1;
    }
  }
});

console.log( Sentencer.make("I can count to {{ number }}.")
// "I can count to 5."
```

#### Actions can take arguments

You can pass arguments into your actions. We can use this to make a smarter version of the random number generator above...

```javascript
var Sentencer = require('sentencer');

Sentencer.configure({
  actions: {
    number: function(min, max) {
      return Math.floor( Math.random() * (max - min) ) + min;
    }
  }
});

console.log( Sentencer.make("I can count to {{ number(8, 10) }}.")
// "I can count to 8."
```

### Add your own custom lists
When configuring `Sentencer` you can provide your own custom lists, which are converted to "actions". The `key` sets the name of the action and the `values` the list of values where one is selected when the action is called. You can also specify a name for the `articlize` and/or `pluralize` actions. These names are referenced within a sentence template.

Here is an example of an animal list that includes options to prefix with an article or to make it plural.

```javascript
var Sentencer = require('sentencer');

Sentencer.configure({
  customLists: [
    {
        key: "animal",
        values: ["dog", "cat", "elephant"],
        articlize: "an_animal",
        pluralize: "animals"
    }
  ],
});

console.log( Sentencer.make("I saw {{ an_animal }}, 1 {{ animal }}, and 2 {{ animals }}.")
// "I saw an elephant, 1 dog, and 2 cats."
```

### Where are the verbs?

Verb pluralization, singularization, and tense modification are difficult computer science problems. `Sentencer` doesn't aim to solve those problems, however _present tense_ verb pluralization/singularization is an experimental feature of [`natural`](https://github.com/NaturalNode/natural) and could be integrated if necessary.

`Sentencer` was created and is maintained by [Kyle Stetz](https://github.com/kylestetz). The original prototype came out of [Metaphorpsum](https://github.com/kylestetz/metaphorpsum) but has been rewritten from the ground up.
